        <h1>The Found Journal</h1>
        <p>
            Once, I found a strange journal in the attic. It was old, the pages brittle with time. 
            What truly caught my attention was the odd sense of familiarity. As though the words 
            had been written by someone I knew, but I couldn’t remember who. If you find this website, please proceed with caution. <p>I have felt strange since reading it.
        </p>
January 1st </p>
New Year, New Life
I did it. I actually did it. I quit my job today. Walked right into the office, shook my boss’s hand, and told him I was done. No more fluorescent lights, no more soul-sucking meetings about profits and quarterly projections, no more pretending that Patricio microwaving fish in the office cafeteria isn’t a war crime (EVERY MONDAY).
Now, I’m actually free!
Okay, maybe “free” is a strong word. Technically, I’m unemployed, single, and just sold my ergonomic office chair for some camping supplies, but let’s focus on the positives.
Everyone at the office thinks I’ve lost my mind. When I told my coworkers I was leaving to become a survivalist, my buddy Jeff just stared at me for a solid ten seconds before saying, “Dude, didn’t you cry when they discontinued Santa Clara diet. You are not built for the wilderness.” Rude, but not entirely inaccurate. Also fuck you Jeff. 
I decided to start a journal of my transformation from corporate zombie to adventurer so I can look back on all of this and appreciate the journey. 
I woke up one day and decided: What’s worse? Spending the rest of my life drowning in spreadsheets and wearing dress shoes? Or taking a chance and actually living? Because right now, I don’t feel like I’m living. I feel like I’m a well-dressed corpsewalker who gets his personality from how much espresso he’s consumed before lunch. 
A month ago my girlfriend, keleigh, dumped me. Over brunch. Who breaks up with someone over brunch? I’d rather it had been a text to be honest. One second, I’m enjoying my avocado toast at arguably the most overpriced restaurant in town, the next, she’s explaining that she needs “someone who actually has passions.” Apparently, being very good at Excel doesn’t count. Nor does TV.  Who knew? I had apparently been “missing the signs that we’d fallen out of love.” I hadn’t missed the signs. It had been three years, and it all went right down the tubes. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t know it was coming. 
Then, two weeks later, I got passed over for a promotion at work. The guy who got it wears suspenders unironically and once said, “Let’s circle back to that” in casual conversation. I was never a violent man, but that pushed me to the edge. That was my breaking point. Right then and there, I decided I was done being miserable. i needed a fresh start. I was going to go down to staples, buy a journal, and document my transformation. Because the best revenge is living well….and I secretly want to be Bear Gryls. Grillis? Grihls. Well no autocorrect in this medium so we’re rolling with it. 
So here I am. No job, no girlfriend (Keleigh, your name is stupid I’ve been waiting to say that for three years), no real survival skills—but a plan…kind of. 
I’m giving myself three months to prepare before I head out into the wild. To learn how to fish, hunt, build shelter, and navigate without Google Maps. I’ve already started studying, but now it’s time to go all in. By studying I’m referring to the 34 video YouTube playlist I made and the premium subscription I cam no longer afford for to skip the ads. 
This is the year I take my life back. Or, you know, the year I get eaten by a bear. We’ll see how it goes.
</p>
January 3rd</p>
It’s strange, waking up without an alarm. I’ve been doing it for so long that I still shoot out of bed at 6:00am. No emails to check, no deadlines looming. Just the quiet hum of my apartment and the weight of what I’ve done (and what I’m not doing…work). 
I spent the morning making a list of everything I need to learn. Fire-making, water purification, trapping, foraging, basic first aid, navigation, shelter-building, harmonica? The list is overwhelming. But if I’m going to survive out there, I have to know it all. 
I went to the local outdoor sporting goods store today and bought a good knife, a flint striker, and a survival manual. The guy at the counter asked if I was going on a trip. I just nodded. Leaving the store there was a homeless man in a tattered carhart jacket and blue jeans that asked me for a dollar. I realized that he probably had way more survival experience than I did. I gave him ten and asked him to share a outdoor survival tip with me. It was “don’t piss where you sleep”.  Thanks Jim. 
</p>
January 7th</p>
First attempt at starting a fire without matches. Failed. Tried again. Failed. 
Tried a third time, because I’m nothing if not determined to prove everyone wrong. Failed again. 
After two hours of grunting, sweating, and aggressively rubbing sticks together like a caveman auditioning for a reality show, I finally got a tiny spark. Then, miraculously, a flicker of flame. I felt like a god. A rugged, self-sufficient, man of the wild. A true survivalist. In your face Kaleigh!
Then, just as I was about to celebrate my greatness… it died. Instantly. Like it knew I wasn’t worthy.
I sat there, staring at the cold pile of sticks and ashes, wondering how on earth humans ever survived long enough to invent microwaves. This was supposed to be easy. I’ve seen people do it on YouTube in, like, thirty seconds. Granted, they probably knew what they were doing, and I was mostly winging it, but still. Fire has been around for thousands of years. You’d think it could cut me a little slack.
I ended up eating a granola bar for dinner, sitting next to my failed fire pit, feeling both humbled and personally offended. Tomorrow, I try again. Because if I can’t even start a fire, how am I supposed to survive out there?
Lesson learned: Fire-making is an art. 
(Stick figure celebrating over poorly drawn fiire)
Also I bought the harmonica. It sounds terrible. I don’t know what I was thinking. No amount of YouTube tutorials is going to help me with this. 
</p>
January 10th</p>
Fishing practice today! Bought a pole from the expensive outdoor excursion, packed a lunch (because I was definitely catching nothing), and headed to the lake, ready to embrace my inner outdoorsman. The pole was the middle of the road option that the kind, handsome, and jacked guy working at the store suggested for me.  Maybe that would be me one day.
 I put on several layers of thermals, and my waterproof boots and headed out. 
Spoiler alert: My inner outdoorsman is either dead or still in hibernation.
I sat there for hours, FREEZING, staring at my line like a man trying to telepathically summon a fish. Nothing. Not a single nibble. At one point, I convinced myself that maybe I did have a fish, but when I reeled in, it was just a clump of seaweed. Exciting moment, though. I needed the thrill. “That was probably a Tuna” I laughed to myself knowing full well it was likely a carp. 
Eventually, an old man fishing nearby noticed my struggle. He had that wise, weathered look—like he had been fishing since before fishing was even invented. He sauntered over, took one glance at my setup, and shook his head. “You need patience,” he said. “You can’t force it. Just wait.”
Then, in the cruelest display of skill I’ve ever witnessed, the guy cast his line, sat down, and within ten minutes, this SOB reeled in a beautiful trout like it was nothing. He even whistled while doing it. He was also great at whistling. It was infuriating. It was the fishing equivalent of dunking on me. Fuck. 
I told him I was planning to live off the land soon. He chuckled, in that way old men do when they know something you don’t. “Nature doesn’t care about your plans, kid.”
That one hit deep. Because, honestly, I don’t think he believed I could do it. And maybe—just maybe—he’s right. Maybe he just noticed my new pole and confident attitude and thought I needed a dose of reality. 
But if I quit now, I’ll never know. So, I’ll be back. Probably with more snacks, because at this rate, I’m going to survive off granola bars and stubbornness.
</p>
January 14th</p>
Today was all about shelter-building, because apparently, I’ll need a place to sleep when I’m out in the wild. Who knew? Since I can’t exactly practice in the middle of the city without alarming the authorities, I ventured into the woods behind my apartment complex—far enough to feel rugged, close enough that I could still order a pizza if things went terribly wrong.
Attempt #1: A complete disaster. I leaned a few branches together, covered them with leaves, and stood back, admiring my definitely not structurally sound creation. It looked... okay? Like something a bear might sneeze on and accidentally destroy. I sat inside, feeling accomplished for all of thirty seconds before the wind picked up and knocked the whole thing over. If nature had eyebrows, it would’ve raised one at me in disappointment. I was feeling like suspenders guy was laughing at me from his corner office on the 24th floor- and it gave me new found motivation. We were NOT going to circle back to this. 
Attempt #2: Lessons were learned. Stronger branches. Better angles. I wedged the main supports deeper into the ground, secured everything with twine, and packed more leaves on top for insulation. It wasn’t pretty, but it held.
I crawled inside, sitting in the dim little space I had created, listening to the wind howl through the trees. It felt... good. Like progress. Like maybe I can do this.
Sure, I was only ten minutes from my apartment, and yes, I went back inside for a hot shower immediately after, but for that one hour, sitting in my makeshift shelter, I felt like a real survivalist. Or at least, like a guy who’s slightly less doomed than he was yesterday.
</p>
January 18th</p>
Took a break from training to sell most of my stuff on Facebook marketplace. My couch, my TV, even my laptop. It’s crazy what people will offer you to trade. I turned down a 2011 civic someone wanted to trade for my mini fridge, but did accept a lot of hiking gear from a guy just my size for the couch.  If I’m serious about this, I can’t be attached to things. Most of this crap had been given to me by Kaleigh’s grandmother anyway that she had forced me to take because Kaleigh told her my apartment looked like a room in a frat house. WHICH IT DIDNT… I don’t think. I wouldn’t know, I wasn’t cool enough to be in Greek life anyway. Most of college was spent studying and driving the 4 hours home on weekends just to be fed. 
It felt weird, watching strangers carry my life away piece by piece. But I also felt… lighter. Speaking of, got a pretty sweet zippo lighter in exchange for my fishtank that had never become home to any fish. Maybe this thing will save my life one day!
</p>
January 22nd</p>
Well, today the weather decided to make its feelings about my survivalist ambitions known. At least it wasn’t over an expensive brunch. Freezing rain, wind so strong it rattled the windows like a horror movie—basically nature throwing a tantrum. I spent the entire morning watching it all from the safety of my apartment, thinking, “Okay, this is it. This is what the wild can throw at me.”
I didn’t even try to go outside. Instead, I sat at my kitchen table, reading about hypothermia and frostbite—because that’s how I’m preparing for a future in the wilderness, apparently: by becoming intimately familiar with all the ways I can freeze to death. Luckily most of my time on this outdoor journey would be in summer, but the nights still get cold up north. Hypothermia can set in in just a few hours, I learned, and frostbite can make your fingers fall off. Or other appendages. Real motivating stuff. The more I read, the more I felt like I might be on the verge of a panic attac and I had already sold, I mean thrown out my Xanax prescription.  I mean, I thought I was ready, but I’m starting to think I’ve got no idea what I’m in for.
I’ve done the whole "outdoorsy" thing in nice weather, sure—day hikes, barbecues, the occasional camping trip where I stayed in a cabin with a hot shower. But this? This is different. This isn’t a weekend adventure. The wilderness is brutal. And yeah, I know it’s not all sunshine and Instagram posts. But reading about frostbite while watching sheets of ice slam into my window—that’s when it hit me.
I don’t think I really understand what I’m getting into. I mean, I know it’s going to be hard, but there’s hard... and then there’s freezing-rain-in-your-face-while-you’re-wondering-if-you-should’ve-bought-the-weatherproof-gloves kind of hard. Not sure I signed up for that.
Not yet, anyway.
</p>
January 27th</p>
Triumph! Victory! A small but mighty win in my ongoing battle with nature—I finally caught a fish today! After all the hours I’ve spent staring at the water, feeling like the fish were just messing with me on purpose, I was starting to think it would never happen. But today, I cast my line, waited, and then—boom! A bite! My heart nearly exploded out of my chest. It wasn’t a huge fish (I think legally I still have to call it “adorable”), but it was mine.
I took it home, cleaned it as best as I could (which was... an experience…okay I cried), and cooked it over a fire in my backyard. No seasoning, no sides, just me and this little fish that I actually caught with my own two hands. And you know what? It tasted different from the kind you buy in a store. Fresher. More... real.
And as I sat there, eating my hard-earned meal under the stars, it hit me—I hadn’t thought about my ex in days. No spiraling, no re-reading old texts and wondering if I could have responded with a better zinger, no wondering why I deserved this. Just me, my fish, and the fire. I don’t know if that means I’m moving on, or if I was just too busy trying not to starve to wallow in self-pity, but either way, it felt good.
This is what I want. Food that I worked for. A life that I earned. A life that’s mine. A real bear grhyllis (god damn it). 
February 1st</p>
I’ve been putting this off for weeks, but today I finally started practicing with a bow. Turns out, archery is way harder than it looks in movies. In my head, I imagined myself drawing back the string with effortless precision, loosing an arrow in slow motion, and watching it hit dead center with a satisfying thunk. In reality? My arms are jelly, my fingers are raw, and I managed to hit the target exactly once—and even that felt like a fluke.
But more than the physical struggle, today forced me to confront something I haven’t wanted to think about: the fact that, at some point, I might have to take a life to survive. Not a fish (which, for some reason, feels different), but a rabbit, a deer—something warm and breathing and looking at me. The thought makes my stomach turn.
I don’t take this lightly. I don’t want to be reckless or cruel. If I have to hunt, I want to do it right—with skill, respect, and purpose. I tell myself that if I do this, if I take an animal’s life, I’ll use every part of it. Maybe I’ll even make myself a rabbit skin hat. That sounds ridiculous, but people have been doing it for centuries, right? Why not me?
Still, I know that if I want to survive for more than a month out there, I can’t just rely on what I can carry on my back. I have to be able to hunt. I have to get better at this. And that means more practice, more sore arms, more frustration.
I don’t know if I have what it takes to do this. But I guess I’ll find out.
</p>
February 5th</p>
Went on a long hike today with a heavy pack, and wow—my feet are screaming at me. My legs feel like overcooked noodles. I sat down on a rock at one point, and for a solid five minutes, I genuinely considered just living there. Maybe start a new life as a rock hermit. Could be peaceful.
But despite all that, I was honestly impressed with myself. This was the longest, hardest hike I’ve done since I started training, and I didn’t quit. Out of everything I’ve been learning—fire-making, fishing, archery—you can’t learn determination. Either you have it, or you don’t. And I have it. I AM DETERMINED.
That realization hit me somewhere along the trail, probably while I was gasping for breath and wondering if my pack was secretly filled with bricks instead of supplies. No matter how tough this gets, no matter how many times I fail at something (and believe me, I will fail), I’m not going to stop. I can’t stop. I’ve spent too much of my life sitting behind a desk, ignoring that voice in my head that kept whispering, this isn’t it. Well, now I’m listening.
Soon, there won’t be any turning back. Five more weeks until I leave the comfort of grocery stores and central heating behind. Five more weeks until it’s just me, the wilderness, and whatever skills I can manage to pull together.
Five more weeks until I find out what I’m really made of. I hope it’s enough. 
</p>
February 15th</p>
Training is intense. Spent the last month learning everything I can—watching videos, reading survival manuals, practicing in the woods behind my apartment. Fire-making, knot-tying, trapping. It’s harder than I thought.
The cold bites. I thought I knew what cold was, but I’ve never truly been cold before. Not like this. The wind cuts through my jacket, and my hands go numb within minutes if I’m not careful.
I bought a good knife, a sleeping bag rated for extreme cold, and a flint striker. But I can’t rely on gear alone. I have to learn how to survive without it.
Only a few more weeks until I leave. The fear is starting to set in, but I have to trust myself to do what I’ve been training to do. 
</p>
February 18th</p>
Made a deadfall trap today. Took hours to set up, adjusting the weight just right. When I tested it, the log barely moved. Failure.
Tried again. And again. It feelt like my fishing failure all over again. 
But, just like fishing…finally, after six tries, it worked. And lucky me had some gnarly squirrel soup for dinner. If I were actually relying on this, I’d be starving by now lol. 
Patience. Precision. Everything out there is going to take twice as long as I expect. But time will be the one thing I have. 
</p>
February 22nd</p>
I pushed myself way too hard today. Morning hike with a full pack? Brutal. Afternoon spent practicing bow drills for fire-making? Even more brutal. Now my hands look like I tried to high-five a cheese grater, my back feels like it’s been used as a punching bag, and I’m so exhausted that if I sat down for more than five minutes, I’d probably just merge with the ground and become part of the landscape.
And here’s the thing—I know I can’t keep doing this. If I collapse out there in the wild, no one’s going to come rushing in with a protein bar and a pep talk. Also, dying alone would be super embarrassing. 
I have to pace myself. Work smarter, not just harder. This isn’t a Rocky montage where I push through the pain and suddenly become a survivalist god. This is real life, and real life comes with blisters and sore muscles and the creeping realization that maybe I’m not as tough as I thought.
But!—and this is a big but—the fire drill finally worked. Took almost an hour of frustration, sweat, and some very creative swearing, but I got a tiny ember. Then a flicker. Then an actual flame. That little dancing spark felt like victory.
I sat there watching it for a while, grinning like an idiot, feeling like some ancient fire-making wizard. Then a gust of wind blew, and the fire immediately went out.
Nature keeps me humble. 
</p>
February 26th</p>
Well, I did it. I spent the whole night outside in my brand-new, supposedly "four-season" sleeping bag. No tent, just a tarp and some branches for wind cover, because I wanted to see if I could handle the cold like a real survivalist. Spoiler alert: I barely did.
The cold wasn’t just cold—it was personal. Like it had a grudge against me specifically. Every gust of wind slithered through my layers like an icy snake, wrapping around my spine and stealing warmth straight from my bones. I spent most of the night curled in the fetal position, shivering, and contemplating all my life choices that led me to this moment. Sleep? Forget about it. The best I managed was a series of short, anxiety-ridden naps, each interrupted by the realization that my toes were slowly turning into icicles.
At one point, around 3 AM, I was convinced I was dying. Not in an actual hypothermia way, but in a "this is how people make dumb decisions and end up on the news" way. If it had been colder, if I had been wetter, if I had literally sneezed too hard and lost a little extra body heat, I might not have made it.
Lesson learned: I need way better insulation. More layers. A real windbreak. Maybe even a tent, which I had sworn off in favor of "embracing the elements." Well, the elements embraced me back, and not in a fun way.
Nature doesn’t care how prepared I think I am. It only cares that I either am prepared… or that I suffer the consequences. And last night? I suffered.
On the bright side, at least I now know exactly what it feels like to be a frozen chicken nugget. Just writing chicken nugget induced drooling. 
</p>
March 1st</p>
Fire-making is officially less of a disaster. I can get a flame going with a flint striker in under two minutes now, which is a huge improvement from my first attempts (which involved a lot of swearing and questioning my life choices). Even using a bow drill, I’ve managed to get it down to fifteen minutes. Still too long, but hey, at least I no longer look like I’m trying to summon a fire demon through sheer frustration.
Also spent the afternoon practicing filtering and purifying water. There’s a stream near my training area that looks clear and refreshing, but I know better. One bad sip, and suddenly I’m experiencing nature in the worst way possible—curled up in a makeshift shelter, dehydrated and regretting everything. I boiled some, used a water filter, even tried a DIY charcoal filter just to see how well it worked. No way am I letting bacteria or parasites ruin this adventure before it even starts.
Survival is all about the basics: fire, water, shelter, and food. Two down. Still working on the others. Also, note to self—stop drinking so much coffee before training days. I’m pretty sure my caffeine addiction is going to be harder to kick than becoming a successful hunter. Maybe I’ll bring a small pack of instant coffee for a really tough day. 
Overall I’d say today I’m feeling proud of what I’ve accomplished. 
</p>
March 5th</p>
Everything is packed. Every item carefully chosen, every ounce of weight accounted for. Knife, flint striker, sleeping bag, tarp, water filter, first-aid kit, and just enough rations to get me started. It doesn’t seem like enough when I lay it all out in front of me—just a small pile of gear to take on the wilderness. But it has to be enough. That’s the whole point.
I’ve stopped telling people about my plan. The ones who know still ask if I’m really going through with it, if I’ve thought this through. They say things like, “You could just go camping for a weekend instead,” or “There’s still time to change your mind.” I smile, nod, and let them talk. They don’t understand.
This isn’t just a trip. It’s not some temporary escape from reality. This is me proving to myself that I can build a life with my own two hands. That I can survive, not just exist.
And honestly? I’ve never felt more ready. The training, the failures, the endless nights of doubt—it all led to this. Tomorrow, I take the first step. No more office, no more meetings, no more pretending to be someone I’m not. Just me, the wild, and the life I’m finally choosing for myself.
Let’s do this. No turning back. 
</p>
March 10th</p>
I’m on my way. No more second-guessing, no more “maybe I should wait just a little longer.” I left everything behind—my apartment, my old life, my terrible desk chair that ruined my posture. No turning back now.
Caught a ride with a trucker heading north. Nice guy, talked my ear off about his grandkids and his collection of vintage beer cans. When he dropped me off, I hopped in with another guy hauling lumber. He asked what I was doing out here, and I panicked for a second. Telling people “Oh, I’m just going to disappear into the wilderness and survive off the land” tends to get you weird looks. So I told him I was looking for work. He nodded, seemed to buy it. Told me if I wanted a real job, I should try hauling logs instead of “bumming around the woods like some hippie.”
Thanks for the career advice, buddy, but I think I’ll stick with the plan.
Now, I’m standing at the edge of civilization. Just me, my gear, and miles of untamed wilderness stretching out before me. The air smells cleaner, crisper. The trees are taller than I remembered. Everything feels sharper—like I’ve woken up from a long sleep.
The road behind me is long. The wilderness ahead is brutal. But for the first time in years, I feel alive. No fluorescent lights. No emails. Just me, the wind, and the adventure that’s about to begin.
Here we go.
</p>

March 20th</p>
First Day in the Wild</p>
I found my spot! Miles from civilization. No roads, no power lines, no cell service. Just trees, ice, and silence. It’s beautiful and terrifying.
I spent the day scouting the area. There’s a stream nearby—cold, fast-moving water. Good for drinking, maybe for fishing. The ground is tough, still half-frozen in places, but I managed to clear a small area for my shelter. It’s crude—just a lean-to made from fallen branches and my tarp—but it’ll do for now.
The cold is worse than I expected. Even with a fire, the wind cuts through everything. I curled up in my sleeping bag and listened to the wilderness around me. No cars. No voices. Just the sound of the trees shifting, the water moving, and the occasional crack of ice breaking somewhere in the distance.
I don’t think I’ve ever felt this alone.
</p>
March 23rd </p>
I underestimated how hard this would be.
Keeping the fire going takes constant effort. If I let it die, even for a little while, the cold sinks into my bones. My hands are cracked and raw from working in the icy air. My shelter helps block the wind, but it’s still freezing at night.
Food is another problem. I made a simple spear and tried fishing in the stream. After hours of failure, I finally got one small fish. It wasn’t much, but it tasted better than any meal I’ve ever had.
Everything takes so much longer than I thought. Just gathering wood for the fire is exhausting. I feel like I’m constantly working just to stay alive.
But I made it through another night. That’s something.
</p>
March 27th </p>
I’m getting better. Faster. Stronger.
Fire-making feels natural now. I can gather the right kind of wood without even thinking. I can start a flame in under five minutes, even in the wind.
Fishing is still hit or miss, but I caught two today. That’s double my usual. I cooked them slowly over the fire, savoring every bite. Food tastes different when you have to fight for it.
The cold still bites, but I’ve started reinforcing my shelter. More layers, more insulation. It’s holding heat better now.
I don’t feel like I’m barely surviving anymore. I’m adapting.
</p>
April 1st </p>
Woke up before dawn, just as the sky was turning pale blue. No alarm, no schedule—just instinct.
I stepped outside my shelter, breathed in the crisp morning air, and felt something I haven’t felt in a long time.
Peace.
Everything here has a rhythm. The trees sway in the wind. The water rushes over the rocks. The birds call to each other as they wake. Even the silence has a pattern.
I moved through my routine without thinking. Gather wood. Stoke the fire. Check my traps. Sharpen my knife. Every action has meaning. Every task is about survival.
I haven’t spoken to another human in nearly two weeks. And I don’t miss it.
</p>
April 7th </p>
I Belong Here. I went deeper into the forest today, tracking a rabbit. It moved fast—darting between trees, disappearing into the underbrush like a ghost. I didn’t catch it, but that wasn’t really the point. I followed its trail for miles, reading the faint imprints in the dirt, noticing the subtle bends in the grass where it had passed. And somehow, without even thinking about it, I found my way back without getting lost. That felt like a victory.
My body moves differently now—quieter, steadier. I step without snapping twigs. I pause to listen before I move forward. I’m not crashing through the forest like an outsider anymore. I’m learning its rhythm. I’m not just surviving out here. I’m becoming a part of this place.
I built a better shelter today—a real one. Not the flimsy lean-tos I started with, the ones that collapsed the moment the wind decided to test my patience. This one is dug slightly into the earth, the walls reinforced with thick branches, the floor lined with pine needles for insulation. It’s warmer, stronger. It feels like something that could last. Maybe something Icould last in.
Tonight, I sat by the fire, watching the flames flicker and dance, sending tiny embers swirling into the dark. And I realized something:
I don’t miss my old life at all.
Not the noise. Not the stress. Not the endless cycle of waking up, commuting, sitting at a desk, answering emails, pretending to care about quarterly reports, then going home too exhausted to do anything but repeat the process the next day. I left all of that behind, and I don’t want it back.
For the first time in my life, I feel free.
Not "weekend free." Not "vacation free." Not "an-hour-at-the-gym-to-blow-off-steam free." Real free.
The kind of free that fills your lungs with cold, sharp air and makes you feel alive. The kind of free that comes from knowing there’s nothing between you and the world but your own two hands and the skills you’ve worked for.
This is what I was searching for. And I think I’ve finally found it.

The Silence is Loud.
The solitude is getting to me. I knew it would be hard, but I didn’t realize how much I’d miss human voices.
At first, it was peaceful. No noise, no distractions. Just the sound of the trees, the stream, the crackle of the fire. But now… the silence feels heavy.
I’ve set some snares, and yesterday, I actually caught a rabbit. I hesitated before killing it, but my stomach made the choice for me. It was the first real meal I’ve had in days.
I keep hearing things at night. Probably just the wind.

The Night Feels Wrong
Three days since my last entry. At least, I think it’s been three days. Time is starting to slip. The sun rises, the sun sets, and everything in between is just survival—wake up, gather wood, check traps, eat if I’m lucky, sleep, repeat. The cycle grinds on, wearing me down like water over stone. My hands are raw from the cold, my body aches, my mind feels... thin. Like stretched fabric about to tear.
Last night, something changed.
I heard it again.
At first, I thought it was the wind—just the trees groaning, shifting in the cold. But wind doesn’t whisper. Wind doesn’t breathe just outside your shelter.
I stayed still, barely breathing, listening. It was faint, just at the edge of hearing, like someone muttering under their breath. When I finally gathered the courage to look outside, there was nothing there. Just the trees standing silent and still, the dark pressing in from all sides.
I told myself it was nothing. That my mind is playing tricks on me. That isolation does this to people. But when I tried to sleep, I felt it. A presence. Just beyond my shelter, watching.
I don’t think I’m alone out here.
This morning, I searched the perimeter, looking for tracks, for any sign that something—or someone—had been nearby. Nothing. No footprints. No broken branches. No disturbed snow. But I know what I heard.
And I know I’m being watched.
I should leave. I should pack up and go before—
No. No, that’s exactly what it wants.
I won’t run. I won’t let this place break me.
But I have to be careful. I have to stay alert. Because something is out here.
And it’s waiting.

Talking to Shadows. I started talking to myself today. Out loud. Just to hear a voice. I held a full conversation with a tree stump while boiling water.
I think I laughed. Or maybe cried. Hard to tell the difference.
The noises at night haven’t stopped. They’re closer now. Could be animals, but they don’t sound like animals.
Maybe it’s just in my head.

I Saw Something...
I swear I saw a figure in the trees today.
I was gathering firewood, and for just a second—there, between the branches—a shape. Human. Watching me.
I ran toward it. Nothing there. Nothing.
Either someone is out here with me, or…
I don’t know which is worse.

The Whispers are Real.
I don’t sleep anymore. I can’t.
The whispers are real. I hear them every night now, circling my shelter. Low, almost too quiet to catch. My fire keeps them back, I think.
The other night, I heard my own name.
There’s nothing out here. No one.
So who’s whispering?
</p>

I Need to Leave.
I tried ignoring it. I can’t.
I hear them in the daytime now. The trees aren’t safe. The water isn’t safe. Even my shelter feels wrong.
I packed my things. I’m leaving at first light.
But something tells me it won’t let me go.
May 7th- something is watching me. 
I know it. Every night I hear movement beyond the firelight.

Bear. I ran. It chased. Clawed me, I stabbed it, I think. Hard to think. Made it to the river. Blood and water is beautiful. I don’t know how long I out. I won’t make it like this.

Woke up in the mud. Hurts to move. Leg is swollen. No food. No fire. No knife. Just pain. I miss my family. My leg is hot. Feels wrong. Red, swollen. Water is the only thing keeping me alive. I don’t think I can walk.

Cold. I haven’t eaten in days. Too weak to stand. Nights are colder without shelter. I can barely keep warm. Saw a bird today. It felt like a dream.
Written over several pages:
Losing Time.
What day it is. Maybe it’s Monday 
My leg smells bad. Too tired to care.
I hear the whispers again. Thought they were gone.  They found me. Happy I’m not alone. 
Maybe the bear’s name was Ghrylls. If I die at least I’ll die laughing.

Can’t Stay.
I have to move. Even if I die. 
Crawled a few feet almost passed out.
I think I’m dying.
Goodbye

September 28th</p>
I’m pleading for help. </p>
Whoever reads this, something is wrong and it’s hard to explain. I woke up today warm. Safe. Somehow…Healed. The confusion was so strong my head hurt. 
The last thing I remember—truly remember—because so much is a blur, is the dirt beneath me, the infection crawling up my leg, the cold sinking into my bones. I was dying. I knew it. My body was failing, shutting down piece by piece. The stars above me blurred, and I felt myself slipping away.
And then—lights. Not the soft glow of the moon, not the scattered pinpricks of distant galaxies. These lights were too bright. Too perfect. White-blue, pulsing, filling the sky. I felt a brief moment of mental clarity that I hadn’t been able to grasp onto in weeks. 
I tried to move, but I couldn’t. I tried to scream, but no sound came. My body lifted—or maybe the world fell away beneath me.
Then I was somewhere else entirely. Lifted out of despair. But lifted where? The pain was gone, replaced by a strange, almost comforting warmth. My body felt light, weightless, empty. 
They were there. The whisperers were there. 
Tall figures, their skin pale and smooth, their eyes too large. Black, reflective. They did not blink. They did not speak. But I could feel them Inside my mind.
They were curious. Studying me. Examining every piece of me—not just my body, but my thoughts, my memories. I felt them sorting through my mind like a book, flipping pages, pausing, lingering on moments that interested them.
I wanted to fight, to resist, but there was no fear. No pain. Just understanding.
And then—nothing.
I woke up in a bed.
A real bed. Soft, clean sheets, the scent of detergent lingering in the fabric. A room too normal, too ordinary. A wooden dresser. A bedside lamp. A window looking out onto a quiet suburban street.
For a moment, I thought I had dreamed it all. That I was back home, that none of it had happened.
But my wounds were gone. My leg, my back—completely healed.
My beard was gone. Shaved clean.
I swung my legs over the side of the bed, heart pounding. Where was I?
Downstairs, I heard voices—a family. A woman, a man, a child. I crept to the staircase, gripping the banister to steady myself. Everything felt too real, too sharp, too clear.
And then they saw me.
The woman screamed. A blood-curdling, primal scream. The man jumped to his feet, eyes wide, fists clenched.
“Who the hell are you?!” he shouted. “How did you get in here?!”
I opened my mouth to answer, but I had nothing. No explanation. No memory.
I did the only thing I could. I ran. Down the stairs and to a door. The first door I tried was not the front door but a door to the basement. The poor man started screaming as I started trying every door to find my way out. Eventually I did. 
I ran for what felt like an hour through a neighborhood I had never seen until I  found a gas station when I asked someone pumping their gas where we were. He gave me a look like I was insane, and muttered “Montana,”. I have never been to Montana in my life. That’s when I noticed a his Montana plates and realized I probably looked insane. 
I stepped inside the store to more appalled stares and saw todays paper. I realized that somehow it is September! I seem to have lost months of time. I took the paper with me even though it feels cursed. The shock was starting to wear off and be replace with utter horror. 
I have no ID. No money. Nothing but the clothes I was wearing in the woods. The same tattered, bloodstained clothes from before.
I don’t remember crossing the border. I don’t remember anything.
But I know one thing for certain…I didn’t get here on my own.

August 1st </p>
I slept in an unlocked car last night. I found a library and searched missing persons reports. Nothing about me. It’s like I was never gone. No news, no search parties.
Was I really missing? Or was I just removed? Nothing seems to make sense and all I have to prove I am a real person is this journal. I used the libraries bathroom and this was the first time I had seen myself in months. I didn’t look like myself. I am a stranger in my own skin. At least I think it’s mine. 
</p>
December 22nd</p>
I had to take a break from writing for awhile while I figured out how I would survive here and came to grips with what has happened to me. I feel oddly mentally clear. 
I thought my survival challenge was going to be in the Canadian wilderness, turns out it was in rural Montana.
I have been working in a kitchen.  A kind local offered me a job washing dishes and I worked my way up to a line cook position so I can pay him to stay in his rental above the restaurant. 
I don’t know what to do. Going back to my old life feels impossible. But I can’t go back to the wild either. Not after what happened.
And then there’s the question I can’t shake: Why did they bring me back?
Did they fix me? Did they change me?
Or did they just want to see what would happen next?
A year ago, I left my job to find something real. Something raw.
I found it. And it nearly killed me.
I don’t know what I am anymore. A survivor? A man who got too close to something he wasn’t supposed to see?
I keep waking up at night, expecting to see those lights again.
Maybe next time, they won’t bring me back.
